# Simple_web_Projects
These simple web projects are small-scale website applications built using basic web technologies, such as HTML and CSS. HTML is used to create the basic structure of a webpage, including headings, paragraphs, forms, and links. CSS is used to style those elements, changing fonts, colors, sizes, and overall visual appearance.
